# mongodb-on-demand-release
This is the MongoDB release, developed using the on-demand SDK.
This release relies on the presence of a reachable and working MongoDB enterprise Ops Manager product, as well as Pivotal Cloud Foundry (minimum version 1.8, last tested in August 2016)
This also has been tested with On-Demand SDK, version 0.5.0, as of August 2016.

This project depends on the on-demand-sdk version 0.5.0 (which can be downloaded from the Pivotal Network) and MongoDB package : mongodb-linux-x86_64-amazon-3.2.7 (downloaded and automatically set up when a cluster creation is instantiated)

Prior knowledge of building BOSH releases is expected, or recommended.
